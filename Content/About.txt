Hi, I'm Lennart!
As a student, I'm always looking for new challenges and exciting projects
where I can let my creativity and passion for programming out.

For me, it's not just about writing code,
but about developing innovative applications that make the world a little bit better.
I am proficient in several programming languages and have hands-on experience in software development and design.
My focus is on exploring new technologies and algorithms, always pushing myself beyond my own limits.

To further my knowledge and skills, I am planning to study General Computer Science.
Already during my school time I was able to gain valuable experience
through internships and participation in the German National Computer Science Competition.
If you have an exciting project or just want to chat,
I am always open for new contacts and would be very happy to hear from you!
