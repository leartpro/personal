Hello, I am Lennart - an open-minded and curious student with a deep fascination for programming and software development.
To me, programming is more than just a hobby; it's a way to express my creativity and push the boundaries of what's possible.

My interests lie in exploring new technologies and algorithms, developing innovative applications that make life easier and better for all of us.
With my expertise in various programming languages and hands-on experience in software development and design,
I strive to find novel solutions that make the world a little better.

When I'm not engrossed in coding, I enjoy spending my free time indulging in sports, spending time with friends, and diving into a good book.
In the future, I aim to deepen my knowledge and skills by pursuing a degree in General Computer Science.
During my time at school, I gained valuable experience through internships and by participating in the German National Computer Science Competition.

I am constantly on the lookout for new challenges and exciting projects that allow me to apply my skills and enthusiasm for programming.
If you have a fascinating project or just want to chat, I would be thrilled to hear from you!
