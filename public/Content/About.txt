Hi, I'm Lennart - an open-minded student with a fascination for programming and software development.
For me, programming is more than just a hobby -
it's a way to express my creativity and explore the limits of what's possible.

I'm interested in engaging with new technologies
and the algorithmic question and developing applications that make life easier
and better for all of us. With expertise in various programming languages
and hands-on experience in software development and design,
I strive to find creative solutions that make the world a little bit better.

When I'm not sitting at the computer, I like to spend my free time with sports, friends and a good book.
In the future I would like to deepen my knowledge and skills
and therefore I will start studying General Computer Science.
During my time at school I was already able to gain experience,
for example in internships and participation in the German National Computer Science Competition.

I am always looking for new challenges and projects where I can use my skills
and enthusiasm for programming. So if you have an exciting project or just want to talk,
I look forward to hearing from you!
